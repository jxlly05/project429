Anvil Max Repair Cost: 100000000
# Set the max cost for an anvil actions (In Lvl's)

Anvil Reset Max Repair Cost: 39
# Should the plugin reset the repair cost of this action if it costs more than this value?
# Note for 1.17.X: client now disallows taking the result item out when above level 39
# Note: clients will not display this correctly if the value is above 39
#       So this plugin will always display the cost as the title of the inventory.
# Note: Will only be checked if it is below or equal to "Anvil Max Repair Cost"

Item Repair Cost TAG Limit: 39
# This not only gives control over the cumulative repair cost of an item, it also
# can be used to prevent the scenario of an item reaching the 32bit int limit of repair cost
# and thus the system not allowing further repairs

# When set with "Enable Item Tag Cap Reset: true" It will clamp the tag.RepairCost nbt of
# Any item in the Anvil to this level. Preventing the repairs from getting more expensive
# over time just by repairing the item. 
# Note: The cost scan still get more expensive with more enchantments etc
